![App File Structure](/app_file_structure.png)

First `62 80 62 80` bytes (red color) is **CatCore Magic Signature** - kernel, apps, kexts all start from these bytes.

Next `02` byte (green color) is **File Type**, where `02` means it's an **.app** (**Application File**).

Next `01` byte (yellow color) is **Application Type**. Check table below to know all the application types (they also are available in `CatCore.ProcessType` variable, except the `CatCore.ProcessType.APP`):

| Number | Type       |
|--------|------------|
| 0      | DUMMY      |
| 1      | KERNEL     |
| 3      | JAVASCRIPT |
| 4      | PYTHON     |
| 5      | PHP        |
| 6      | RUBY       |

Next `01` byte (dark blue color) is **Application Flags** (bitfield). Check table below to know all the bitfield flags:

| Flag    | Name   | Description            |
|---------|--------|------------------------|
| 1 \<< 0 | SIGNED | Application is signed. |

If application has `SIGNED` flag, next 256 bytes (purple color) is a **Signature**.

Everything else after that (light blue color) is an **Application Manifest**, which is reversed Base64 of a JSON object. JSON object **doesn't** have a strict structure, the only requirement is `code` property, containing the application code itself.
