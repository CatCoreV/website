title: First OS
description: How to make and boot your first OS.
---

import { File, Folder, Files } from "fumadocs-ui/components/files";
import { Terminal, AppWindow } from "lucide-react";

Let's make your first OS, by the end of this guide you will have the following file structure:

<Files>
  <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="overlay-fs" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="system" defaultOpen>
        <File name="system.js" />
        <File name="logo.png" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen />
    <File name="system.json" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

Start by creating all the folders (but `src/apps` is optional!), and then let's make `src/system.json` file (which is, actually, optional too):

```json
{
  "name": "ExampleOS",
  "version": "v0.0.1",
  "logo": "/system/logo.png",
  "loading": "circle"
}
```

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="name" id="systemjson-name">
    It's the name of your OS as a string, which will be the name of your executable, app window and as a `CatCore.systemName` variable inside your code. It's recommended to set this value, but the default is `"System"`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="version" id="systemjson-version">
    It's the version of your OS as a string starting from `v`, which will be available as `CatCore.systemVersion` variable inside your code. It's recommended to set this value. If it's not starting from `v`, it will be automatically added (`0.0.1` --> `v0.0.1`).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="logo" id="systemjson-logo">
    Optional logo of your OS at boot screen and app icon. Must be a string of a **CatCore path** (check example with `overlay-fs` above).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="loading" id="systemjson-loading">
    Sets boot screen loader style. Must be `"circle"` or `"bar"`, defaults to `"circle"`.
    Circle is similar to Windows 11 boot and bar is similar to iOS/MacOS boot.
    This choice is decorative, but bar can have a progress percentage (how much % of the bar is filled), giving more information to the user.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

Once you have made the folders, `system.json` (or decided to skip it) and logo file (optional), you need to create a file for your OS code.

OS code file must be in `/system` mount, named `system` or `sys`, and have any supported language extension. Currently supported languages: **JavaScript**, **Python**, **PHP**, **Ruby**, but this list will increase in future updates.

Once you have created the file, paste this example code:

<Tabs groupId="oslanguage" items={["JavaScript", "Python", "PHP", "Ruby"]} persist>
  <Tab value="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    CatCore.loadProgress();
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    CatCore.loadProgress()
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="PHP">
    ```php
    <?php
      $CatCore->loadProgress();
    ?>
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Ruby">
    ```ruby
    CatCore.loadProgress()
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Next, compile your first OS and open it. After some waiting, you should have a black screen - congratulations with your first OS! 🎉

<Callout title="Troubleshooting">
  If you have some issues and do not get a black screen, press `Ctrl + Shift + F8` inside your OS, even while it's booting. There's a great chance a **logs panel** will open up containing enough information to fix problems. If you still can't get your first OS to work, contact CatCore support using [Discord](https://discord.gg/AU5PBWxeVN) or [GitHub](https://github.com/CatCoreV).
</Callout>

For future development, you may use some IDE that can speed up your OS development. I recommend **VSCode**, as it's the only one tested with **CatCore**. To use IDE integration, just open `os-compiler` folder in your IDE and if your IDE supports it, it will automatically pick-up all the needed files. You might need to compile at least 1 time for IDE integration to work properly. If you're using **JavaScript**, your IDE might not like top-level `await`, even though it's supported - we can't fix this issue, so you'll have to just add an async wrapper.

And lastly, you should learn how to control the bootscreen:

<Tabs groupId="oslanguage" items={["JavaScript", "Python", "PHP", "Ruby"]} persist>
  <Tab value="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    // Loop from 1% to 100%
    for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
      // Set the loading progress
      CatCore.loadProgress(i);
      // Wait 0.1 seconds
      await CatCore.delay(0.1 *CatCore.SECOND);
    }

    // Without an argument, it completely ends the boot and hides the boot screen
    CatCore.loadProgress();
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Python">
    ```python
    import asyncio

    async def main():
      # Loop from 1% to 100%
      for i in range(1, 101):
        # Set the loading progress
        CatCore.loadProgress(i)
        # Wait 0.1 seconds
        await CatCore.delay(0.1 *CatCore.SECOND)

      # Without an argument, it completely ends the boot and hides the boot screen
      CatCore.loadProgress()
    
    asyncio.run(main())
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="PHP">
    ```php
    <?php
      // Loop from 1% to 100%
      for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
        // Set the loading progress
        $CatCore->loadProgress(i);
        // Wait 0.1 seconds
        await $CatCore->delay(0.1 *CatCore.SECOND);
      }

      // Without an argument, it completely ends the boot and hides the boot screen
      $CatCore->loadProgress();
    ?>
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Ruby">
    ```ruby
    # Loop from 1% to 100%
    (1..100).each do |i|
      # Set the loading progress
      CatCore.loadProgress(i)
      # Wait 0.1 seconds
      await CatCore.delay(0.1 *CatCore::SECOND)
    end

    # Without an argument, it completely ends the boot and hides the boot screen
    CatCore.loadProgress()
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout title="Did not understand?">
  If you have trouble understanding the code, you probably **should** learn English (words like **delay** or **load progress**) or your programming language (like `for` or `await`).
  In JavaScript, top-level `await` is allowed, even if your IDE does not think that.
  If you're a Ruby developer, you might not know about `await`, as Ruby does not have that keyword, so you'll have to learn it like in other languages. Simple explanation of `await` is just to **wait** for that function to finish, even if it takes a long time in the background.

Now, that you have basic understanding of CatCore, you can make a **text-based terminal OS**, a **graphical OS**, or even both at the same time, and it's **your** choice, so choose what you want to start with:

<Cards>
  <Card href="/en/docs/text-mode" icon={<Terminal />} title="Text mode">
    I choose to learn how to interact with CatCore's **text mode** and make a text-based terminal OS.
  </Card>
  <Card href="/en/docs/gui/window" icon={<AppWindow />} title="Graphical mode">
    I choose to start learning GUI (Graphical User Interface) and start making a basic window.
