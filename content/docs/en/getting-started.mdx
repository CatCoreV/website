description: How to install and use the compiler.
---

Welcome! Let's start by installing `os-compiler`, which will be referenced later as just *compiler*.

Compiler is required for you to easily compile your OS and apps source code, add kernel and all the needed libraries, and make the final binaries.

Start by downloading latest [os-compiler](https://github.com/CatCoreV/os-compiler) release from **GitHub** either manually or via terminal:

```bash
git clone --branch v0.0.1 https://github.com/CatCoreV/os-compiler.git
```


After that, enter `os-compiler` folder and run install script depending on your host OS:

<Tabs groupId="hostos" items={["Windows", "Linux", "MacOS"]} persist>
  <Tab value="Windows">
    ```bash
    .\install-windows
    ```

    Now, just open `catcore_compiler.exe` to open compiler GUI:
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Linux">
    ```bash
    chmod +x install-unix.sh && ./install-unix.sh
    ```

    Now, just open `catcore_compiler` to open compiler GUI:
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="MacOS">
    ```bash
    chmod +x install-unix.sh && ./install-unix.sh
    ```

    Now, just open `Catcore Compiler` to open compiler GUI:
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

First I would recommend to learn about all the compiler buttons:

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="Language Selector" id="language-selector">
    That "**EN v**" at top left corner is a language selector.
    At the moment of writing this, officially supported languages are **EN**glish and **RU**ssian,
    but feel free to contribute adding more languages!
    You do **not** need to restart the compiler to change the language.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Title Bar" id="title-bar">
    You can move the compiler window just by holding it at the top and dragging it.
    There's also a minimize and close buttons.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Compiler Block" id="compiler-block">
    Compiler block has a version number of the compiler you have.
    Click on the arrows icon on the right to check for updates and automatically install them.
    After update is done, you'll have to launch the compiler again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Kernel Block" id="kernel-block">
    Kernel block has a select menu, where you can choose a version of the **bootloader** + **kernel** to use.
    Bootloader and kernel are the main core of your OS, so I would recommend to use the newest version.
    Versions are sorted from the newest to the oldest, which means the first one is the newest and recommended to use.
    Use arrows icon on the right to reload the list of versions, which is useful in case a new kernel version releases, while your compiler was still opened.
    Below, there's an **architecture** select menu, you have to compile for specific CPU architecture, otherwise your OS will not boot at all. Currently supported architectures are **x64** and **ARM64**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="System Block" id="system-block">
    System block just contains the name of the folder that contains your OS, which by default is `src`.
    This is useful for compiling multiple operating systems, by just having them in separate folders.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Result Block" id="result-block">
    Result block contains a **target** select menu. Target means where your OS will be launched.
    For development, it's recommended to use an **app** - your OS will be compiled as an executable binary for your host OS, so you don't have to reboot or use a virtual machine.
    **CatCore** supports compiling an app for **Windows**, **Linux** or **MacOS**.
    For production, use **Bootable .iso** target, which is currently internally work in progress, so it's locked, as well as other targets. ***COMING SOON.***
    There's also **Windowed** mode, which makes your OS a simple window, instead of a full-screen application that captures keyboard by it's maximum, making it harder to exit.
    New **Quick** mode allows you to use cache of previous compilation to highly speed up the next one.
    Since you just opened the compiler, it's **locked**, but once you'll do a compilation, it will unlock.
    Note that if you change any setting (like the kernel version, architecture or target), quick compilation will lock again.
    > Quick compilation is useful, but it also keeps old files in `/data` mount, which can break your OS in some rare cases, but that's your OS issue, which you probably **should** fix if it happens!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bottom bar" id="bottom-bar">
    Bottom bar contains a status of the compilation, like **Ready!**, which displays what is currently happening.
    Use big **COMPILE!** button to start the compilation with your settings.
    On the right, there's also two smaller buttons: **Start** and **Stop**. They're used for quickly opening the app you have built or closing it to recompile.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

Now, that you have understanding of the compiler, you can continue this guide to make and boot your first OS.
