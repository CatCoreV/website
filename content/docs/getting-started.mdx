Welcome! Let's start by installing `os-compiler`, which will be referenced later as just *compiler*.

Compiler is required for you to easily compile your OS and apps source code, add kernel and all the needed libraries, and make the final binaries.

Start by downloading latest [os-compiler](https://github.com/CatCoreV/os-compiler) release from **GitHub** either manually or via terminal:
```bash
topcatto@CAT-PC:~ $ git clone --branch v0.0.1 https://github.com/CatCoreV/os-compiler.git
```

After that, enter `os-compiler` folder and run install script depending on your host OS.

```bash
topcatto@CAT-PC:~ $ cd os-compiler
```

```bash
# Windows
D:\os-compiler> .\install-windows

# Linux / MacOS
topcatto@CAT-PC:~/os-compiler $ chmod +x install-unix.sh && ./install-unix.sh
```

Now, just open `catcore_compiler` / `catcore_compiler.exe` / `Catcore Compiler` depending on your host OS.
